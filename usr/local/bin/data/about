That being said, myself and/or my team have lives outside developing StormOS, we will NOT and CANNOT spend our time handholding anyone, we mean no offense it is just our disclaimer! NOR will we help nor handhold anyone with any forks or  their own project based on StormOS! FYI We have a post install application which you can update via a bottom button on the utility program." \
